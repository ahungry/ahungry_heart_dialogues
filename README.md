# Ahungry's The Heart of Baldur's Gate (dialogues)

This is the static compilation output of the generated dialogue 
files from https://github.com/ahungry/ahungry_heart

It is included in the other project as a git submodule, so that the output files here do
not clutter up the workspace of the main project, while still allowing version tracking.

Expect a lot of code churn here.
